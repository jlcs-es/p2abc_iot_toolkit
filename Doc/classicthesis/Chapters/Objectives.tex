In this chapter we describe the project objectives, and the methodology followed during its development. In section ... TODO

\section{Project description}

The purpose of this project is the integration of IBM's privacy preserving solution, Idemix, in the environment of the Internet of Things. The objective is to design a general solution for the existing IoT devices and systems, without compromising any feature of Idemix, and provide a working PoC in a real IoT environment, even though it isn't the most constrained scenario. The project is aimed to be used in privacy preserving environments, providing security for IoT, controlling what data is being disclosed and to whom. In a smart city project, citizens data can be privatized and continue to offer the benefits of the sensors around. Authorized personnel can disclose the information when required, like firefighters that could access a building sensors to know how many people and what conditions they are in, in case of a emergency; and keep such invasive data private to other non-critical services, for example, only giving a proof that there are more than a minimum number of people in the building, to activate or deactivate the air-conditioning system.

\hfil

We will divide the project in various \textbf{objectives}, starting from the principal goal, dividing our work in different categories.

\hfil

\paragraph{Idemix and the IoT}
We part from this main objective, integrating IBM's privacy preserving system in the IoT environment. 

\paragraph{Analysis} Study the state of the art for Idemix and the IoT, analyzing related projects like ABC4Trust's \ac{P2ABCE}, papers with similar approaches, and our task is to consider the best fitting solutions from where to start.

\paragraph{Design and implementation} After studying the existing works, we must give a formal solution to be implemented. This includes the theoretical architecture, the steps to take, the software to implement, the hardware to use, and any simplifications to leave as future work.

Our \textbf{software} objectives include making it easily maintainable, structured and extensible, from the IoT and original project perspectives, that is, the IoT solution must be interoperable with other non-IoT solutions, now and in the future, with minimal effort, given new IoT systems or changes in the cryptographic protocols.

Our \textbf{hardware} objective is to use devices as constrained as possible. But considering our early situation in the project, we will use IoT devices that ease testing and development, having in mind the other devices, and what specific steps we should take for them in the future.

\paragraph{Validity and evaluation} Deploy a \ac{PoC} in a \textbf{real scenario}, without the need of simulators, checking it works as expected, and measuring its performance.



\section{Methodology}

Giving the vast range of IoT devices, a one-for-all solution must take in consideration multiple requirements and limitations. We will break down the original system, Idemix and P2ABCE, analyze every part of it and categorize them. We will consider what components are mandatory to be executed in the target device and which ones the devices would be able to execute.

Devices with equivalent processing power to smart phones are capable to execute the current Java implementations of P2ABCE and Idemix, but the most constrained ones can't handle the entire system, only the key cryptographic operations.

Using the technique known as \textit{Computation Offloading} we will design an IoT architecture where the most constrained targets can keep their private keys and certificates secure in the same device, and act as any other User in the P2ABCE system. Studying the P2ABCE architecture and implementations we will identify those mandatory operations to be executed in the constrained device, and how to communicate efficiently during the delegation.

After the technical design, we will implement the PoC, using software designs patterns known to many professionals, that will improve the maintainability of the project, for improvements and fixes. Taking advantage of this practices, we can document the immediate steps for future developers, how to reimplement certain interfaces when porting the application to a new system, or where the core logic lies for future protocol changes.

Finally, the PoC must be evaluated to assert we achieved our goals, and measure its performance, judging if it could be fitting for real IoT environments.



\section{Analysis of P2ABCE}

% TODO: explicar P2ABCE


In the \ac{P2ABCE} repository \citep{p2abcurl} is available the project's code, divided in two solutions: a complete P2ABCE implementation in Java and a Multos Smartcard implementation as companion for the project.

The Java code is managed by a Maven project, structured using various known design patterns, but not of our interest. The structure we are actually interested in are the REST Services and their use of the Components classes, in which the smartcards are included.

P2ABCE project is based on the concept of smartcards to store the credentials, logical or physical. An interface is defined to communicate with these smartcards, and then different implementations allow to use either \textit{Software Smartcards} or \textit{Hardware Smartcards}. 

The \textit{SoftwareSmartcard} class implements the interface in Java, suitable for tests and self-stored smartcards that any application using P2ABCE may need.

The \textit{HardwareSmartcard} class uses the standard APDU messages [TODO:ref] to interact with smartcards. P2ABCE defines for every method in the mentioned interface, the necessary APDU instructions, and currently relies on \textit{javax.smartcardio} abstract classes (implemented by Oracle in their JRE) to communicate with the smartcard reader. This way, it doesn't matter what manufacturer issues the smartcard, or if it's an Android device, if they support the APDU API, P2ABCE will work with them.

\begin{figure}[bth]

		\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{gfx/p2abceBasicUML}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Basic P2ABCE structure}
	\label{fig:p2abceBasicUML}
\end{figure}


As a PoC the P2ABCE project includes the ABC4Trust Card Lite, an implementation for ML3-36K-R1 Multos Smartcards. The code is written in C, but is very dependent on the Multos framework, aside from numerous bugs and bad coding habits. 



At this stage, we have two options to implement our IoT device compatible with P2ABCE:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Implement in C the \textit{Smartcard} interface used by P2ABCE architecture, and use some communication protocol to remotelly call the methods from the machine running the P2ABC Engine.
	\item Present the IoT device as a hardware smart card, using the APDU protocol (already defined, standard and with minimal overload). Providing a \textit{javax.smartcardio} ``IoT implementation'' to communicate with the IoT device through a transmission protocol, the already existing \textit{HardwareSmartcard} class can work with the new \textit{IoTSmartcard} in the IoT device.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{ABC4Trust Card Lite}

%TODO: as part of P2ABCE project, this MULTOS PoC

%TODO: check content

P2ABCE provides a smart card reference implementation, ABC4Trust Card Lite \citep{ABC4TCardLite}. It supports device-bound U-Prove and Idemix, and virtually any discrete logarithm based pABC system.

Version 1.2 is based on MULTOS ML3 cards, with approximately 64KB of EEPROM (non-volatile memory), 1KB of RAM and an Infineon SLE 78 microcontroller, a 16-bit based CPU aimed for chip cards.

The card stores the user's private key $x$ and any \ac{BLOB} that the P2ABCE may need (like user's credentials). Then P2ABCE delegates the cryptographic operations on the smart card, that operates with $x$.

\begin{figure}[bth]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{gfx/ABC4TCardLite}
	\end{center}
	\caption{ABC4Trust Card Lite}
	\label{fig:ABC4TCardLite}
\end{figure}

The cryptographic operations performed by the smartcard are the modular exponentiation and addition that discrete logarithm ZKPs are based on.

\hfil

The code is available from the P2ABCE project and has some good and bad points to have in count:

The best asset of this code is that it's written in C aiming to a very constrained device, similar in computational power to many IoT devices, and very limited memory.

Some \textit{tricks} in the code include using \textit{union} data types for variables that will be stored on the same data location, but at different moments (e.g. depending on APDU Command INS byte), minimizing this way the use of RAM and making code readability better; or strong use of pointers and \textit{memcpy} calls to copy structures with multiple variables as arrays of bytes.


Among the many drawbacks, we could highlight the awful coding, the strong dependency on MULTOS framework and some bugs found. 

The code is structured in two files, \textit{main.h} and \textit{main.c}, with 557 and 5157 lines of code respectively.

The file \textit{main.h} is mostly a reimplementation in assembly MEL of some MULTOS functionality already offered with latest \textit{multos.h}.

The \textit{main.c} consists on near 600 lines of variables and data structures declarations, followed by the \textit{main()} function, a 2635 lines long \textit{switch-case} with practically no comments, and to conclude, the implementation of thirty functions called \textit{Subroutines} at the end of the file.


This gives an idea of the problematic to maintain or even understand the code. But once one studies MULTOS framework in deep and applies many refactoring techniques to ABC4T Card's code, this becomes the best starting point for the IoT version.




\section{Preliminaries about smart cards}


\subsection{Smart Card Communication Protocol}

To communicate the smart cards and the reader the ISO/IEC 7816-4 \citep{APDUISO} specifies a standardized protocol .

The messages, also kown as \acp{APDU}, are divided in APDU Commands and APDU Responses.

\textbf{APDU Commands} consist in 4 mandatory bytes (CLA, INS, P1, P2), and an optional payload.

\begin{itemize}
	\item CLA byte: Instruction class. Denotes if the command is interindustry standard or proprietary.
	\item INS byte: Instruction code. Indicates the specific command.
	\item P1, P2 bytes: Instruction parameters.
	\item Lc, 0-3 bytes: Command data length.
	\item Command data: Lc bytes of data.
	\item Le, 0-3 bytes: Expected response data length.
\end{itemize}

This way, minimal number of bytes are needed to transmit commands to the smart card, allowing manufacturer's personalization of the smart card behavior and capabilities along with standard operations.

\begin{figure}[bth]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=0.55\linewidth]{gfx/APDUCommand}
	\end{center}
	\caption{APDU Command}
	\label{fig:APDUCommand}
\end{figure}


\textbf{APDU Responses} are generated inside the smart card, always as an answer to an APDU Command. They consist on an optional payload and two mandatory status bytes.


\begin{itemize}
	\item Response data: At most Le bytes of data.
	\item SW1-SW2 bytes: Status bytes. Encode the exit status of the instruction.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[bth]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=0.55\linewidth]{gfx/APDUResponse}
	\end{center}
	\caption{APDU Response}
	\label{fig:APDUResponse}
\end{figure}




\hfil


The transmission protocol varies between different types of readers and smart cards (e.g. chip, contact-less), but what is common between every smart card interaction, is the \textit{APDU Command-Response Dialogue}. As long as the smart card has a power supply, it can maintain the memory in RAM between APDU Commands, what allows to do in two or more steps complex operations, transmit more bytes than a single APDU can admit, etc.

\hfil




\begin{figure}[bth]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{gfx/APDUdialog}
	\end{center}
	\caption{APDU Command-Response Dialogue}
	\label{fig:APDUdialog}
\end{figure}

Originally, the Lc and Le bytes had only 1 byte, if present, restricting the payload data to be at most 256 bytes long. An extension to the protocol changed the meaning of a Lc or Le 0x00 byte (256 bytes long payload), so when the byte corresponding to Lc or Le started with 0x00, the next two bytes where the real length.  With this, an Extended APDU lets up to $65536$ bytes of data.

The problem here, is that not all readers or smart cards support extended APDUs. Originally, to send more than 256 bytes of data in an APDU Command, a \textit{Put Data} instruction is defined, so the smart card stores the payload in a buffer, until other APDU Command indicates how to use it.

To send more data in an APDU Response, the status bytes are set to: SW1=0x61 and SW2 to the remaining bytes to send. Because a smart card can't send APDU Commands, the card terminal must send a \textit{GET RESPONSE}, a special APDU Command, with Le set to the number of bytes specified in SW2. Iterating this process, the smart card can send as many bytes as it wants as Response.

With the introduction of Extended APDUs, this technique is no longer needed.






\subsection{MULTOS}

MULTOS is a multi-application smart card operative system, which provides a custom developing environment, with rich documentation \citep{MultosTechLib}. MULTOS smart cards communicate like any other smart card following the standard, but internally offers a very specific architecture, affecting the way one must code applications for it.

In this section we will present the main characteristics of a MULTOS smart card that shaped the ABC4Trust Card Lite code and that we had to be aware of when adapting it to IoT devices.

\paragraph{MULTOS programming languages} A native assembly language called MEL, C and, to a lesser extent, Java, are the available languages to code for MULTOS. In our case, ABC4T Card Lite uses MEL and C.

\paragraph{MULTOS Workflow}

Most of the transmission and communication process is done by MULTOS core, and it then selects, based on the CLA byte of the APDU, the application to load. This application is what most developers will only worry about, and is where their $main()$ function will start.

\begin{figure}[bth]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{gfx/multosWorkflow}
	\end{center}
	\caption{MULTOS Workflow}
	\label{fig:multosWorkflow}
\end{figure}

The application uses then the \textit{multos.h} file that declares multiple global variables already loaded with the needed data, including the APDU Command bytes.

Now the developer is in charge of checking what instruction was sent and if the APDU has the expected ISO Case. If everything is ok, code what needs to be run and write in specific data space the APDU Response bytes, call \textit{multosExit()} and MULTOS will be in charge to send the APDU Response.

In summary, our application starts with all data loaded and exits without worrying how to send the answer. A very comfortable workflow that we must now implement for our IoT device if we would want ABC4T Card Lite code to work.

\paragraph{MULTOS Memory Layout}

Each application in MULTOS has access to a specific memory layout, divided in different categories:

\begin{figure}[bth]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{gfx/multosMemLay}
	\end{center}
	\caption{MULTOS Memory Layout}
	\label{fig:multosMemLay}
\end{figure}


The Code Space is where the application code is stored.
The Data Space is divided in Static memory, Public memory and Dynamic memory.

\textbf{Static memory} are the application variables declared after the specific \textit{\#pragma melstatic} compiler directive. These variables are stored in the non-volatile EEPROM, and any write is assured to be saved because they are not loaded into RAM.

\textbf{Public memory} can be seen as the input/output buffer for applications and MULTOS system. The APDU header appears at the top of Public, and command data at the bottom. The application writes then the APDU Response bytes in Public, at specific position (see \autoref{fig:multosPubMem}). To declare variables in this data space, the \textit{\#pragma melpublic} directive is available.

\textbf{Dynamic memory} works like usual program memory, with Session Data storing global variables and the Stack. The limited size of RAM in IoT devices and smart cards makes the use of dynamic memory not advisable. The compiler directive to use Session Data is \textit{\#pragma melsession}.


\begin{figure}[bth]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{gfx/multosPubMem}
	\end{center}
	\caption{MULTOS Public Memory Data Map}
	\label{fig:multosPubMem}
\end{figure}


\hfil


With regards to primitive types, to avoid confusion with their sizes, MULTOS defines and uses the following data types specified in \autoref{fig:multosDataTypes}. It's important to notice that MULTOS is Big Endian
\marginpar{\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{gfx/Big-Endian}\\Big-Endian, Wikipedia}
and when storing structures there is no padding between defined variables, unlike modern compilers that perform data structure alignment \citep{dataStructAlign} for performance.

\begin{figure}[bth]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{gfx/multosDataTypes}
	\end{center}
	\caption{MULTOS Data Types}
	\label{fig:multosDataTypes}
\end{figure}


\paragraph{MULTOS Standard C-API}

A collection of more than a hundred functions are provided for arithmetic, cryptography, memory and smart card operations. The \textit{multos.h} interface provides access to these functions, that ultimately call their respective primitive instructions in assembly code. The primitive instructions are but a system call with an operation code, loading data in the needed registers. Therefore,  no implementation for these tools is available, nor in C, nor in assembly code.

Nevertheless, the C-API documentation \citep{MultosTechLib} provides rich description for each function.






\section{Development environment}



The development is divided between the \ac{IoT} device code and the \ac{P2ABCE} services. To ease the setup of new developing machines, we will use Docker to create compiling containers.

\hfil

The P2ABCE is already written in Java, and few modifications will be done to the code in comparison to the existing project size, so we will continue using Java with the P2ABCE part.

P2ABCE project needs some minor changes to work with the IoT architecture. It is written in Java using Maven to manage the project dependencies. Any text editor or Java IDE is suitable for the development, because the compilation is done through the terminal, with Maven commands.

We compile the project inside a Docker container, with OpenJDK 7, Maven and the Idemix Maven plugins installed, following the project \href{https://github.com/p2abcengine/p2abcengine/wiki/How-to-Build-the-ABC-Engine}{instructions} to use Idemix as the Engine for P2ABCE.

\hfil

We can assume all IoT devices have a C cross-compiler, some even a C++ cross-compiler. The worst case scenario is that one must write assembly code, and that code will be specific of that target, so we won't consider them.
If now we focus on the most constrained devices, we could find out that some can't compile C++, some may not have many common libraries, and that the memory limitations they face make practically impossible to use dynamic memory, if we want to avoid many execution malfunctions.

For that reason, the developed code for IoT devices should be written with standard C, without using dynamic memory or third party libraries.

\hfil


To manage the PoC code we chose CMake, providing many advantages over Makefiles:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Cross-platform. It works in many systems, and more specifically, in Linux it generates Makefiles.
	\item Simpler syntax. Adding a library, files to compile, set definitions, etc. can be done with one CMake command, with rich documentation on the project's \href{https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/}{website}.
	\item Cross-compilation. With only a \href{http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/CMake_Cross_Compiling#The_toolchain_file}{\small{CMAKE TOOLCHAIN}} file, CMake sets up automatically the cross-compilation with Makefiles and the C/C++ cross-compiler provided.
\end{itemize}


\hfil

Although the ideal final code is pure C, without external libraries or dynamic memory, the \ac{PoC} uses three major libraries:

\begin{itemize}
	\item OpenSSL: Provides reliable and tested AES128, SHA256 and random number generator implementations.
	\item LibGMP: Provides multiprecision integer modular arithmetic.
	\item cJSON: Provides a JSON parser to store and read the status of the device, in a human readable way.
\end{itemize}

These three libraries are used to implement different interfaces in the project, and C implementations of these interfaces should replace the external libraries in the future.

\hfil

Finally, we use Docker to deploy the compilation environment. Our container includes CMake and the LEDE SDK \citep{ledeproject}, configured for the Omega2 target, the device chose for the PoC.

The Dockerfiles can be found in the Appendix.
